                <p>
                    Everyone who lives in Columbia or any city with major train lines running through it knows the pain of waiting for a slow train and showing up to your destination 20 minutes late. The problem is not knowing the train schedules throughout Columbia and being late because of them. The problem is more specifically not knowing the optimal route to get to your destination while taking train delays into consideration.
